A Jekyll plugin that provides users with a traditional CMS-style graphical interface to author content and administer Jekyll sites.

I think this is so far the best offline Jekyll CMS among all. This is built by the Jekyll team and works amazingly well.

The setup is easy. You will have to add one or two extra gems to your jekyll site. That’s all.

TikTok recently organised an educational workshop in Dhaka, focusing on platform navigation and content strategy. The event drew local creators and provided an overview of TikTok's functionalities through sessions like TikTok 101. The workshop placed emphasis on networking, offering attendees the chance to connect and discuss potential collaborations.

Sreeya Debnath, a local content creator, reflected on the recent workshop, "I went in sceptical, thinking it might just be the same old repetitive mantra. But what I experienced was a genuine effort from TikTok to educate and uplift. They delved into the 'whys' of content creation, which was enlightening. Knowing why 'finding your niche' is pivotal and understanding the profound connection it establishes with audiences was a game-changer for me."

Earlier this year, TikTok also hosted multiple workshops on its Community Guidelines in Bangladesh. Through these workshops, TikTok showed how Community Guidelines serve as a comprehensive framework that outlines the rules and standards governing the platform's usage. Numerous content creators, journalists, social media managers, and other stakeholders took part in these workshops.

With such tailored local workshops and events on the rise, TikTok is aiming to build a robust community of local content creators. To support its user base, TikTok continues to provide various resources, such as editing tools and trend analysis. The platform's growing objective is to offer an accessible environment for content creators of all backgrounds in Bangladesh.
