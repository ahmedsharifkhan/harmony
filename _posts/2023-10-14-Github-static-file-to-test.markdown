Description: It is distressing to see the widening gulf between what people expect from parliament and what our parliamentarians actually deliver.

In India, the popularity of online trading has helped transform the financial landscape. This has led to over 20% of all trading is now done via mobile through trading apps. In line with this, another development many traders have highlighted is the use of algorithmic trading systems to take advantage of ever-changing market opportunities. To date, algorithmic trading systems are used in up to 60% of all trading volume.


What are algorithmic trading systems?
Algorithmic trading systems, or algo-trading for short, refers to the use of computer programs to automatically execute trades in financial markets. These trades are based on predetermined rules set by the trader. With a single program, traders are able to process large amounts of data and make trades at high speeds, which helps them take advantage of online trading opportunities. These programs are also able to react in a more timely manner and reduce any risks associated with sudden volatile dips before significant losses are incurred.

How do algorithmic trading systems work?
Essentially, algo-trading uses mathematical models and statistical analysis to execute trades in financial markets. A computer program is responsible for an automated trading approach that is able to process market data and make trades without constant human supervision. Apart from profit opportunities for the trader, the algorithm also makes trading more systematic by ruling out the impact of human errors on trading activities.

To ensure success, it is critical to use the right programming language. Different programming languages have their own strengths and weaknesses, and the wrong choice can slow down the analytical process and lower profitability. Furthermore, the varying data structures within different financial markets may require the use of a specific programming language for optimal performance.


Currently, the common programming languages used in algo-trading include Python, Java, C++, and R. As explained in our program cheatsheet, Python is popular for its versatility. In algo trading, this versatile nature means that traders can experiment with different strategies first without needing to commit to more complex codes. Additionally, it has a more understandable syntax that ensures accessibility across most trader levels. However, R is a popular choice for traders who are focused on maximizing statistical analysis and data visualization. Regardless of the programming language used, it is important to use the one that will simplify development and reduce complexity for trading.

Application of algorithmic trading systems
Given the capabilities of algo-trading, applying its use is fairly easy. There are several exchanges and brokers in India that offer algo-trading platforms and services. At present, this includes the National Stock Exchange of India (NSE) and the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE).


In terms of specific assets, several can benefit from algo-trading. Indices Trading decisions can be made with more nuance given algo trading's real-time reactions. Since the indices market allows for speculation on the performance of an index rather than investing in it, traders can program their algorithm to capitalize on the movements of prices without getting distracted by the actual stock's standing. This is important for traders, as an algorithm can rapidly analyze data and prices across the thousands of global indices across large and small companies.


The massive interest in cryptocurrencies within India is also an area where algo trading can thrive. Creating the right algorithm with crypto in mind ensures that trades are executed consistently within a predefined strategy to prevent losses with volatile digital assets. This is also timely given the planned digital currency from the BRICS bloc, as India can take advantage of algo trading to keep up with changes dependent on all of the concerned countries.


As it stands, the application of algo trading has created a digitally driven community where the future remains bright for Indian traders. After all, India has a robust population of software developers, where 5.8 million individuals work to provide top-notch programs. As such, traders are looking forward to even more innovations that can enhance the investment industry.
